# Moving_Object_Detection_Video
Moving_Object_Detection_Video is a computer vision project built using Python and OpenCV to detect moving objects in video streams. It processes frames in real time using background subtraction, frame differencing, and contour detection to identify motion and draw bounding boxes, useful for surveillance and traffic monitoring applications.
